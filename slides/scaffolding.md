##  Scaffolding

* What does it to?
  * Generate a "starter project"
  * Easily create skeleton files for new features
* Languages/Platforms
  * [Ruby on Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html) - "rails new"
  * Python - tools like [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)
  * Web - Yeoman (next slide)
  * Web search "[my language] scaffolding" and you'll probably find something!

<small>Although useful, scaffolding can constrain you to someone else's way of thinking. Critically analyze any scaffolding system you use for suitability!</small>
