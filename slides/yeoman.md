  * [list of generators](http://yeoman.io/generators)
* Expose commands to *scaffold* components for you as you work

### To install

npm install --global yo
npm install --global [generator name]

note:
  Scaffolding - ever type the same starter code out again and again? Scaffolding does that for you
