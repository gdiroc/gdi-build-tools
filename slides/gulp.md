##  Gulp

[gulpjs.com](http://gulpjs.com/)

* Functional approach
* Configuration over convention
* NodeJS - it's just JavaScript!
* Let's learn some gulp!

note:
  Functional approach - most of your code will be calling other functions - you won't be writing much normal javascript with gulpjs
  Configuration - set it all up yourself, lots of flexibility
  Convention - they have a certain way of doing things, you need to conform to that way. How webpack is, convention is why I ditched it for this class
