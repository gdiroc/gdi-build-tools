* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
  * Older, still in use for existing projects, not used for new projects
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
  * The "now hotness"
  * Great for a highly-modular app that centers around javascript
  * Harder for smaller HTML/CSS websites
* [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts)
  * Very simple to get started with
  * Lots of freedom
  * Can be less efficient than gulp (not always)
* [Many](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli) [many](http://brunch.io/) [many](https://github.com/jakejs/jake) [others](http://mimosa.io/)

  Lots of opinions out there! Use what you're comfortable *if* it works for your use case!
